I believe that Apache Licence 2.0 is a good license. Firstly, the author can keep his patent. Then everyone can use his code. I think that 
this way can encourage more and more people to finish and perfect it. For example, Apple is a big company and Steve Jobs had a good start 
when Iphone 4 come out. Today, there is no Jobs any more in this world but Apple is still there and the products of it still attract plenty
of people all around the world. So in my mind, though the first version could be very low and had plenty of bug. It is a good start and will
correct unexpected result in the future. And it is important to let people think of that first guy though in this public website. Secondly, 
It is good to limit that the user could not make advertisement by using original author's name. This liscence could also be a hold harmless 
agreement. The original author just wants to create a new stuff. It is bad for some scheming people to use his name for money or other 
antisocial behavior. Finally, in this licence, the user must make statement on the part that they add or change. I beleve this is perfect 
becasue in some case, it seems that patent is inheriting.
